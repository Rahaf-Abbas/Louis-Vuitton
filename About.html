            <h1>Louis Vuitton Marketing Strategy – What is louis vuitton</h1>
            Louis Vuitton is the world's most valuable luxury brand and is a division of LVMH. Its products include leather goods, handbags, trunks, shoes, watches, jewelry and accessories. Most of these are adorned with the LV monogram. It is one of the most profitable brands in the world with profit margins north of 30%. Louis Vuitton launched its first perfume in 70 years during 2016, and LVMH built a state-of-the-art fragrance factory to develop the perfumes. Actress Emma Stone was the star of Louis Vuitton’s first fragrance film. The brand added men's fragrances last year. Maison Louis Vuitton launched a new Paris flagship store in 2017, and the brand celebrates its 165th anniversary this year. Actresses Léa Seydoux and Alicia Vikander continue to serve as brand ambassadors for Louis Vuitton.
   
  
  <h1>A LEGENDARY HISTORY</h1>
  When he was only sixteen years old, Louis Vuitton made a decision that would not only change his own life but the lives of his sons and future generations: he would become a trunk-master.

HOW IT ALL BEGAN
Louis Vuitton’s heritage as a trunk maker preceded even the founding of the company.

It was in 1837 that a 16-year-old Louis Vuitton arrived in Paris by foot and started apprenticing for Monsieur Maréchal. At the time, horse-drawn carriages, boats and trains were the main modes of transportation, and baggage was handled roughly. Travelers called upon craftsmen to pack and protect their individual objects.
Louis Vuitton quickly became a valued craftsman at the Parisian atelier of Monsieur Maréchal. These were the roots of his highly specialized trade; the beginnings of his career in an artisanal industry that called upon skills to custom design boxes and, later, trunks according to clients’ wishes. Louis Vuitton stayed for 17 years before opening his own workshop at 4 Rue Neuve-des-Capucines near the Place Vendome.
